# Giph of a lightbulb #

   This repo includes frames of .txt files that contains ASCII conversions of
   simple lightbulb giph (frame by frame).

   Other than a living example of how to animate a giph to ASCII animation in CLT
   (command line terminal), it probably is not very useful. 

  ## How to use ##

     ```
     ruby animate.rb
     ```
